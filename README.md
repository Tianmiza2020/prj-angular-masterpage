## Introduction

In modern web development, a master page serves as a template for other pages in an application. It helps maintain a consistent layout and design across different views. This project demonstrates how to create a master page using Angular, along with responsive design techniques.

## Project Overview

The **prj-angular-masterpage** project aims to provide a clear example of how to set up a master page in an Angular application. By following this guide, you will learn how to leverage Angular features, such as lazy loading and standalone components, to create an efficient and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates several key technologies:

- **Angular 19**: The latest version of Angular, providing powerful features for building web applications.
- **Angular CLI**: A command-line interface for Angular that simplifies project setup and development.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for responsive design.
- **Flex Layout**: A layout library for Angular that helps create responsive layouts.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the project.
- **Grid Layout**: A CSS layout technique for creating complex web layouts.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **Lazy Loading**: A technique for loading modules only when needed, improving performance.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Ensures that web applications look good on all devices.
- **SCSS**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.
- **Standalone Components**: Angular components that can be used independently.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **prj-angular-masterpage** project, you will need to have a few tools installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Angular CLI**: Install Angular CLI globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tianmiza2020/prj-angular-masterpage.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd prj-angular-masterpage
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Serve the Application**:
   Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the application.

## Usage

The master page is set up to serve as a template for various components. You can easily add new components by following these steps:

1. **Generate a New Component**:
   Use the Angular CLI to generate a new component:
   ```bash
   ng generate component new-component
   ```

2. **Update the Master Page**:
   Include the new component in your master page layout. This ensures that the new component inherits the styling and structure of the master page.

3. **Test Responsiveness**:
   Use the built-in tools in your browser to test how the application looks on different screen sizes.
